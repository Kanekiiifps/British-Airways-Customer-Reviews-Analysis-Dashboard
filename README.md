Project Overview
This is an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes customer reviews for British Airways. It helps visualize key insights like overall ratings, trends over time, ratings by country, and performance by aircraft type. The data comes from public sources like Skytrax or Kaggle datasets on airline reviews.
